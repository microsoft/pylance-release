- **`python.analysis.userFileIndexingLimit`**: Limits the number of user files indexed in the workspace. In `full` mode, there is no limit (`-1`), allowing comprehensive indexing of all files.

- **`python.analysis.functionReturnTypes`**: Enables inlay hints for function return types in `full` mode, providing additional type information during development.

- **`python.analysis.pytestParameters`**: Enables inlay hints for Pytest function parameters in `full` mode, enhancing test development support.

- **`python.analysis.supportRestructuredText`**: Enables support for reStructuredText in docstrings in `full` mode, allowing for richer documentation rendering.

- **`python.analysis.supportDocstringTemplate`**: Enables support for docstring generation in `full` mode, facilitating better code documentation.

- **[`python.analysis.packageIndexDepths`](docs/settings/python_analysis_packageIndexDepths.md)**: Used to override how many levels under installed packages to index on a per-package basis. By default, only top-level modules are indexed.

  - **Default value**:
    ```jsonc
    [
        { "name": "sklearn", "depth": 2 }, 
        { "name": "matplotlib", "depth": 2 }, 
        { "name": "scipy", "depth": 2 }, 
        { "name": "django", "depth": 2 }, 
        { "name": "flask", "depth": 2 }, 
        { "name": "fastapi", "depth": 2 }
    ]
    ```
    or in `full` mode
    ```jsonc
    [
        { "name": "", "depth": 4, "includeAllSymbols": true }
    ]
    ```

  In `full` mode, this ensures comprehensive indexing of submodules, improving features like auto-import and symbol searches for deeply nested packages.Â For more detail, please refer to the link above.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: What are the benefits and drawbacks of using `full` mode?

**A:** `Full` mode provides the most extensive set of features, including advanced IntelliSense, type checking, comprehensive indexing, and auto-imports. This mode is ideal if you need full language support, especially for complex projects. However, it requires a lot of system resources, such as memory and CPU power, which means it may not be suitable for very large projects or systems with limited hardware. If your system struggles with performance issues while using `full` mode, consider switching to `default` or `light` mode.

### Q: How does `light` mode affect existing projects and what features are disabled?

**A:** In `light` mode, Pylance does not analyze closed files, perform indexing, extract type information from library code, or provide Pytest support. This reduces resource usage but limits IntelliSense features like auto-import suggestions, workspace-wide code navigation, find all references, and multi-file rename. Editor features such as completion, hover, and go-to definition will still work, but third-party library symbols may be unavailable if stubs or type information are missing, which can also affect diagnostics.

### Q: Can I customize individual settings after switching to `light` mode?

**A:** Yes, you can individually override any of the settings adjusted by `languageServerMode`. For example, you can re-enable indexing or Pytest support by explicitly setting those configurations in your `settings.json`.

### Q: Is `light` mode suitable for all types of development?

**A:** `Light` mode is ideal for large projects, systems with limited resources, or when you require a lightweight editing experience. If you need comprehensive IntelliSense and code analysis across your entire workspace, `default` mode is recommended.

### Q: How do I know if I should switch to `light` mode?

**A:** If you experience performance issues, such as high memory or CPU usage, slow editor responses, or lag in IntelliSense features, trying `light` mode may help. You can monitor system performance and adjust settings as needed.
