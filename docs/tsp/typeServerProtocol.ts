 * It's Python specific at the moment, but may be made generic in the future.
 *
 * This protocol is used to communicate between the type server and the client (e.g., a language server or an IDE).
 *
 * All the types in this file should be JSON serializable, as they are sent over the wire.
 * The protocol is designed to be extensible, allowing for future additions of new requests and notifications.
