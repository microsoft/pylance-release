## Overview

`reportMissingTypeStubs` is a diagnostic in Pylance and Pyright that warns when a module is missing type stubs (`.pyi` files) or type annotations. This helps catch missing type information for third-party libraries, improving static analysis and type safety.

## Representative Issues

-   [#9393](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright/issues/9393): Ensure that all modules within the 'google.cloud' namespace include a 'py.typed' marker and appropriate type annotations to avoid errors like 'reportMissingTypeStubs'.

## Common Fixes & Workarounds

1. Install or generate type stubs (`.pyi` files) for third-party libraries.
2. Use libraries that provide type annotations or a `py.typed` marker file.
3. Contribute type stubs to the typeshed repository or the library itself if missing.
4. Review the [Pyright configuration documentation](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright/blob/main/docs/configuration.md#reportMissingTypeStubs) for options to adjust or suppress this diagnostic if needed.
