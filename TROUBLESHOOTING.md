# Troubleshooting

If you're having trouble with the language server, check the below for information which
may help. If something isn't covered here, please file an issue with the information given
in [Filing an issue](#filing-an-issue).

## Known issues

## Common questions and issues

### Unresolved import warnings

If you're getting a warning about an unresolved import, first ensure that the
package is installed into your environment if it is a library (`pip`, `pipenv`, etc).
If the warning is about importing _your own_ code (and not a library), continue reading.

The language server treats the workspace root (i.e. folder you have opened) as
the main root of user module imports. This means that if your imports are not relative
to this path, the language server will not be able to find them. This is common
for users who have a `src` directory which contains their code, a directory for
an installable package, etc. Note that the `src` scenario is automatically detected
by the language server, so no configuration is necessary in that particular case.

These extra roots must be specified to the language server. The easiest way to
do this (with the VS Code Python extension) is to create a workspace configuration
which sets `python.analysis.extraPaths`. For example, if a project uses a
`sources` directory, then create a file `.vscode/settings.json` in the workspace
with the contents:

```json
{
    "python.analysis.extraPaths": ["./sources"]
}
```

This list can be extended to other paths within the workspace (or even with
code outside the workspace in more complicated setups). Relative paths will
be taken as relative to the workspace root.

Note that if you are coming to Pylance from using the Microsoft Python Language Server, this setting has changed from `python.autoComplete.extraPaths` to `python.analysis.extraPaths`.

### Migrating from the Microsoft Python Language Server to Pylance

If you are moving from the Microsoft Python Language Server over to Pylance, a good place to start is by reading [our migration doc](MIGRATING_TO_PYLANCE.md) which outlines a couple notable changes between the language servers.

### Minimum VS Code version

To use Pylance, you will need to be using VS Code version 1.57 or above.

### Pylance does not start up, or shows an error on startup

To use Pylance, you must be running an official build of VS Code. If you've verified that
you are running an official build and are still running into issues, please file a bug report.

### Packages do not resolve on install when using WSL

If you are using Pylance in a WSL environment, make sure your workspace is located under a WSL folder (`/home/...`) and not shared with Windows (`/mnt/...`).
See issues [#1443](https://github.com/microsoft/pylance-release/issues/1443#issuecomment-867863124) and [vscode-remote-release#5000](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-release/issues/5000).

## Filing an issue

When filing an issue, make sure you do the following:

-   Check existing issues for the same problem (also see the "Known Issues" section above for widespread problems).
-   Enable trace logging by adding `"python.analysis.logLevel": "Trace"` to your settings.json configuration file.
    -   Adding this will cause a large amount of info to be printed to the Python output panel.
        This should not be left long term, as the performance impact of the logging is significant.
-   Select "View: Toggle Output" from the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows/Linux, Command+Shift+P on macOS), then select "__Python Language Server__" in the dropdown on the right.  
-   Copy the entire log starting with "Pylance language server XXX (pyright xxx) starting"
    
-   State the environment where your code is running; i.e. Python version, the virtual environment type, etc.
    -   If using a virtual environment, please include the requirements.txt file.
    -   If working with a conda environment, attach the environment.yml file.
-   A code example (or any other additional information) we can use to reproduce the issue.
