Select "View: Toggle Output" from the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows/Linux, Command+Shift+P on macOS), then select "Python Language Server" in the dropdown on the right. Look for the line Pylance Language Server version X in the console.

## Logs

<!--
Enable trace logging by adding "python.analysis.logLevel": "Trace" to your settings.json configuration file.

Adding this will cause a large amount of info to be printed to the Python output panel. This should not be left long term, as the performance impact of the logging is significant.
